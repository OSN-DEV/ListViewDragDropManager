### ListViewDragDropManager

This project is a modified version of the code provided on CodeProject
with the article [Drag and Drop Items in a WPF ListView][1], written by
Josh Smith. Out of a desire to use it for some of my projects, I've
repackage the code as a library targeting version 4.5 of the
.NET Framework, and put it here on GitHub.

The project is available on NuGet [here][2], and on SymbolSource
[here][3]. For more information about the project and how to use it,
please refer to the article on [CodeProject][1].
